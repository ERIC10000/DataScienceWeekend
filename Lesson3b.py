# Looping/Iterative in Programming
# Block of code is executed a number of times provided the limit is not reached
# while -> Infinite Loop
# for loop -> Simplified
# resaasignent operators

# while loop
# start
# Limit
# increment/decrement

# count = 0  # start, only checked once
# while count < 10:  # limit
#     print(count)
#     # count = count + 1  # inc
#     count += 1
# print 100 to 10
# start = 100
# Limit = 10
# Dec
print("===============")

# number = 100
# while True:
#     print("Welcome to Data Science")

# Even numbers between 20 to 12 ,e,g  20, 18 ... 12
even = 20  # start
while even >= 12:
    print(even)
    even = even - 2
