# Conditional Control Flow
# comparison, identity operator, logical
# syntax if, if expression:

# number = int(input(" Enter Number to test: "))
# if number < 0:
#     print("The Number {} is Negative".format(number))
#
# else:
#     print("The number {} is Positive".format(number))
# # print(number<0)

# Applying modulus (%) test weather a number is odd or even
# even is divisible by 2
# odd is not divisible by 2
# 100 % 2 == 0:
# 101 % 2

number1 = int(input("Enter Number: "))
if number1 % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")

else:
    print("odd")

# Nested If conditions
# Test weather is greater than 50
